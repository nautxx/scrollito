# Scrollito: Auto-scroll for Kavita

Adjustable, pausable auto-scrolling for
[Kavita](https://www.kavitareader.com/)'s Webtoon reader.

An independent project. Not affiliated with, endorsed by, or part of the Kavita
project.

The script adds a compact play/pause and speed control to Kavita manga-reader
pages. It works as a userscript in modern browsers and can also be loaded as a
temporary Safari Web Extension on macOS.

For extension-free clients—including an iPad Home Screen web app—the included
Docker injector can place the same script into Kavita's HTML at the server.

## Features

- Adjustable scrolling from 25 to 600 pixels per second
- Play/pause control suitable for mouse or touch
- Automatically hides the controls while scrolling and reveals them on input
- Can automatically start when Kavita enters Webtoon mode, and the Docker
  injector can turn auto-start or slip mode on by default
- Can be placed in any screen corner and remembers the selection
- Keyboard shortcuts can be remapped from the settings menu and are
  remembered per browser
- A button in Kavita's own reader menu cycles the control between hidden, a
  play button on its own, and the full control; hiding stops scrolling and
  leaves nothing over the page
- Moves out of the way when Kavita's reader menu opens
- Lets Kavita's notification popups draw over the control, so they stay
  readable in whichever corner it sits
- Pauses when you scroll, click, or touch outside the control
- On iPhone and iPad, holding a finger down to pause keeps iOS's
  save-image menu and text magnifier out of the way, and leaves Kavita's
  tap-to-open reader menu closed; all three behave normally again once
  scrolling stops
- Slip mode keeps the set pace through a manual scroll, so you can swipe
  ahead or back up a little without stopping
- Remembers the selected speed in the browser
- Handles Kavita's normal and fullscreen Webtoon readers
- Supports Kavita installations hosted at custom domains or base paths
- Makes no network requests and includes no analytics or telemetry

## Install

The userscript/extension methods below run client-side: install on each
browser or device you read from, and they work against any Kavita server you
can open in that browser, including ones you don't administer. The
[Docker injector](#docker-injector) instead runs server-side: set it up once
in front of your own Kavita instance and every client that visits it gets the
script automatically, with no per-device install.

### Safari on iPhone or iPad

1. Install the free
   [Userscripts app](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/userscripts/id1463298887).
2. Open Userscripts once so it creates its folder in Files.
3. In **Settings > Apps > Safari > Extensions**, enable Userscripts.
4. Download the
   [raw userscript](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nautxx/scrollito/main/scrollito.user.js)
   and save it in the folder selected by Userscripts.
5. Open your Kavita reader in Safari, allow Userscripts access to the website,
   and reload the page.

### Safari on macOS

The Userscripts method above also works on macOS. For a temporary native Web
Extension test instead:

1. Download or clone this repository.
2. In Safari **Settings > Advanced**, enable **Show features for web
   developers**.
3. In **Settings > Developer**, enable **Allow unsigned extensions**.
4. Click **Add Temporary Extension…** and select the repository folder.
5. Enable **Scrollito**, grant access to your Kavita website,
   and reload the reader.

Safari removes temporary extensions after 24 hours or when Safari quits.

### Chrome, Firefox, Edge, and other desktop browsers

1. Install a userscript manager such as
   [Tampermonkey](https://www.tampermonkey.net/) or
   [Violentmonkey](https://violentmonkey.github.io/).
2. Open the
   [raw userscript](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nautxx/scrollito/main/scrollito.user.js).
3. Confirm installation, open a Kavita Webtoon, and reload the reader if it was
   already open.

### Docker injector

The injector sits between your public reverse proxy and Kavita. It serves the
script from the same origin and adds its script tag to Kavita's HTML, so no
browser extension is required.

Build it locally from the repository root:

```bash
docker build \
  --file injector/Dockerfile \
  --build-arg AUTOSCROLL_VERSION=1.3.3 \
  --tag ghcr.io/nautxx/scrollito-injector:1.3.3 \
  .
```

See [`examples/docker-compose.yml`](./examples/docker-compose.yml) for a full
example. Point Caddy or your other public reverse proxy at the injector's port,
not directly at Kavita. `KAVITA_UPSTREAM` may be changed when your Kavita
service uses another Compose hostname or port. The example includes a local
build definition; remove its `build` block if you only want to pull the
published GHCR image. The injector also reads these optional values from the
Compose environment:

- `AUTOSCROLL_TOGGLE_SHORTCUT` (default `s`)
- `AUTOSCROLL_SLOWER_SHORTCUT` (default `[`)
- `AUTOSCROLL_FASTER_SHORTCUT` (default `]`)
- `AUTOSCROLL_HIDE_SHORTCUT` (default `a`)
- `AUTOSCROLL_SPEED_STEP` (default `25` pixels per second)
- `AUTOSCROLL_AUTO_START` (default `false`)
- `AUTOSCROLL_SLIP_MODE` (default `false`)

Set them in the Compose `.env` file and recreate the injector container. Values
use the browser's `KeyboardEvent.key` names, such as `Space`, `ArrowDown`, or a
single printable character. Avoid double quotes and HTML-special characters in
shortcut values. `AUTOSCROLL_SPEED_STEP` must be a positive number and controls
both the keyboard increment and slider step.

`AUTOSCROLL_AUTO_START` and `AUTOSCROLL_SLIP_MODE` accept `true` or `false`
and decide how those two toggles start out for a reader who has not touched
them. They are defaults, not policies: once someone flips either toggle, that
browser keeps their choice and ignores the configured value.

### Keybindings

Put the exact key name in the Compose `.env` file. Common values are:

| Physical key | `.env` value |
| --- | --- |
| Enter | `Enter` |
| Spacebar | `Space` |
| Up arrow | `ArrowUp` |
| Down arrow | `ArrowDown` |
| Left arrow | `ArrowLeft` |
| Right arrow | `ArrowRight` |
| Letter S | `s` |
| Left bracket | `[` |
| Right bracket | `]` |

For example, this uses Enter to toggle scrolling and the arrow keys to adjust
the speed by 10 pixels per second:

```dotenv
AUTOSCROLL_TOGGLE_SHORTCUT=Enter
AUTOSCROLL_SLOWER_SHORTCUT=ArrowDown
AUTOSCROLL_FASTER_SHORTCUT=ArrowUp
AUTOSCROLL_SPEED_STEP=10
AUTOSCROLL_AUTO_START=true
AUTOSCROLL_SLIP_MODE=true
```

Key names are case-insensitive. Each binding must be one key; combinations
using Control, Command, or Alt are intentionally ignored. Recreate the injector
container after editing `.env`.

## Usage

- Select the play icon to begin and the pause icon to stop.
- Move the slider to change speed.
- Select the settings (sliders) icon to open settings. From there, move the
  controls to any corner or enable **Auto-start in Webtoon mode**.
- Press `S` to toggle scrolling on a hardware keyboard.
- Press `[` or `]` to decrease or increase speed.
- Select the Scrollito icon at the left of Kavita's reader menu, or press `A`,
  to step the control through three sizes: **full**, then **hidden**, then
  **play button only**, then full again. Hidden stops scrolling and leaves
  nothing over the page. Play button only keeps scrolling with just the
  play/pause button on screen. The icon is lit whenever the control is showing
  and stays in the menu either way, so Kavita's own icons never shift. The eye
  icon in settings hides the control directly. Scrollito remembers whether you
  last used the full control or play button only; after a reload, a hidden
  control comes back. On a Kavita whose menu layout is not recognized, there is
  no play-button-only size, and a small tab stays in the corner while hidden.
- In settings, select the keyboard icon to remap shortcuts. Select a key
  (`S`, `[`, `]`, or `A`) and press any key to reassign it, or `Escape` to
  cancel. Remapped shortcuts are remembered in that browser and take
  priority over the Docker injector's configured keys.
- In settings, select the up-and-down arrows icon to turn on **slip mode**.
  Scrolling then seeks instead of stopping: swipe ahead, swipe back, or spin
  the wheel, and auto-scroll carries on at the set speed from wherever you
  land. It holds still while a finger is down and picks up again when you lift
  it. Use the pause icon or `S` to stop while slip mode is on.
- Scrolling, clicking, or touching outside the control pauses auto-scroll,
  unless slip mode is on.
- While auto-scroll is running, the controls fade away after 2.5 seconds of
  inactivity. Move the pointer, touch the page, or use the keyboard to reveal
  them. The controls remain visible while paused.

Kavita must be using its **Webtoon** reader mode. The controls appear only when
Kavita's infinite scroller is active, including when a reading profile or
Automatic Webtoon Reader Mode selects it. If you install the script while a
reader is already open, reload that page once.

## Permissions and privacy

Self-hosted Kavita instances can use any hostname, so the script matches
HTTP(S) pages whose path contains `/manga/`. It does nothing beyond those
matched pages.

The script does not read credentials, call Kavita APIs, send data, or load
remote code. Its only stored values are the scrolling speed, preferred control
corner and size, auto-start and slip-mode preferences, and any remapped keyboard
shortcuts, all in that site's local browser storage. Review the complete
source in [`scrollito.user.js`](./scrollito.user.js).

## Browser support

The Safari scroll behavior is tested on macOS. The userscript uses standard web
APIs and is designed for current Safari, Chrome, Firefox, Edge, and compatible
userscript managers. iPhone and iPad installation is supported through
Userscripts, but device and Kavita-version differences may require testing.

## Contributing

Bug reports and pull requests are welcome. When reporting a problem, include
your browser, operating system, Kavita version, whether fullscreen was enabled,
and the reader URL with private hostnames or identifiers removed.

### Local UI preview

Run the dependency-free preview from the repository root:

```bash
./scripts/preview.sh
```

Open the URL printed in the terminal. The script starts at port `8080` and
automatically tries the next port if it is already occupied. The page loads the
working copy of `scrollito.user.js`, mocks Kavita's Webtoon reader and
animated menus, and reloads automatically after either preview source changes.
Use the on-page buttons or press `M` to toggle the reader menu and `X` to expand
its settings area.

## Packaging a release

Run:

```bash
./scripts/package.sh 1.3.3
```

This creates a userscript, a WebExtension ZIP, and `SHA256SUMS.txt` under the
versioned `build/release/v1.3.3/` directory. The injector image uses the
userscript at the repository root as its source, so the browser and server
packages stay on the same version.

Pushing a matching tag such as `v1.3.3` runs the release workflow. It publishes
the assets as a GitHub release and builds `linux/amd64` and `linux/arm64`
injector images in GitHub Container Registry.
